# Bot-Ross-server
Bot-Ross is my oldest project and has switched from role to role, at first being just a bunch of random JavaScript functions thrown together into a system to help me manage my day to day task and automate some aspects of my life while communicating using Discord. I’m currently writing it in Deno after moving away from Node.
